# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains my journey of learning Python, covering fundamental concepts and practical implementations. Below is a summary of each topic covered in this repository.

## Topics Covered

### 00_google_colab
- Introduction to Google Colab as a development environment for Python.
- Setting up and running Python code in Colab notebooks.
- Basic features and shortcuts for efficient coding in Colab.

### 01_introduction_to_python
- Overview of Python as a programming language.
- Features and advantages of Python.
- Writing and executing a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### 02_data_types
- Understanding Python's built-in data types:
  - Numeric types (`int`, `float`, `complex`).
  - Boolean type (`bool`).
  - Sequence types (`list`, `tuple`, `range`).
  - Text type (`str`).
  - Mapping type (`dict`).
  - Set types (`set`, `frozenset`).

### 03_operators_keywords_variables
- Python operators:
  - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, etc.
- Keywords in Python and their uses.
- Variables:
  - Naming conventions.
  - Variable assignment and scope.

### 04_strings_casting
- Working with strings:
  - String manipulation (slicing, concatenation, formatting).
  - Common string methods.
- Type casting:
  - Converting between data types (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`, etc.).

### 05_control_flow
- Conditional statements:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- Loops:
  - `for` loops, `while` loops.
  - Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

### 06_lists_tuples_dict
- Lists:
  - Creation, indexing, slicing, and methods.
- Tuples:
  - Immutable sequences and their uses.
- Dictionaries:
  - Key-value pairs, methods, and iteration.

### 07_sets
- Sets and frozensets:
  - Properties and operations (union, intersection, difference).
- Practical applications of sets.

### 08_modules_functions
- Functions:
  - Defining and calling functions.
  - Parameters, arguments, and return values.
  - Lambda functions.
- Modules:
  - Creating and importing modules.
  - Standard library modules.

### 09_exception_handling
- Handling exceptions:
  - `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`.
- Built-in exceptions and raising custom exceptions.

## How to Use This Repository
